vexbot_rosbuild
===============

ROS driver for a simple educational robot.

This package is no longer being maintained and exists for historical reasons. It has been replaced by [vexbot](https://github.com/calderpg/vexbot) for ROS Groovy and above. You should only use this package if you need compatibility with ROS Fuerte.
